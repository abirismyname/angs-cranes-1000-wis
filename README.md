## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

This template is configured to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages. To enable it:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. The site will automatically deploy when you push to the `main` branch
4. Your site will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

The deployment workflow is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and will:
- Build the Vite application with the correct base path
- Upload the build artifacts
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

🧹 Just Exploring?
No problem! If you were just checking things out and don’t need to keep this code:
